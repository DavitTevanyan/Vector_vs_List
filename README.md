# Vector vs List

A collection of educational examples by the participants of the [MASIS Programming Class](http://masisclass.com/p/c-programming-class.html) demonstrating various engineering aspects of programming that go contrary to theory.

A classic example is when insertions into and deletions from the middle of a `std::vector` are orders of magnitude faster than into and from `std::list` due to CPU cache and prefetching effects.

MASIS Programming Class takes place at the [Information Technologies Educational and Research Center](http://ysu.am/science/en/1350282102) of the Yerevan State University.

MASIS stands for Modern Applications and Software Infrastructure Systems.
